#Smart City Demo

This project is a simple React application. It uses the @dnd-kit/core and @dnd-kit/sortable libraries to create a drag-and-drop interface for sorting different energy sources.

Features
- Energy Sources: The application displays a list of energy sources, including Solar, Wind, Coal, Gas, and Oil. Each source is represented as a draggable card that displays the source's name and its usage percentage.

- Drag and Drop: Users can rearrange the energy sources by dragging and dropping the cards. The order of the cards is maintained in the application's state.

- Bootstrap Styling: The application uses Bootstrap for styling, providing a clean and modern user interface.

Usage
To run the application, clone the repository and install the dependencies using npm install. Then, start the application using npm start dev.
